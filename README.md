The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) is a prestigious international robotics competition that ignites the imaginations of students worldwide. It challenges participants to showcase their creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical prowess in designing and programming robots for a variety of tasks and challenges.

One of the most dynamic categories within WRO is the Future Engineers category. Here, participants are tasked with developing innovative solutions to real-world problems using robotics and automation. This category serves as a breeding ground for future innovators, encouraging students to think critically and creatively, laying the groundwork for a new generation of engineers and technologists.

This year, the Future Engineers category presents an exciting challenge: creating a self-driving car. This challenge pushes participants to explore the cutting edge of robotics, adding layers of complexity and innovation to an already thrilling competition.

# ROBOT AIM and OBJECTIVES
Aim The aim of the robot is to swiftly maneuver its environment or parkour. This involves

# Objectives:

1. Detect obstacles in the environment.
2. Avoid obstacles in the environment.
3. Perform (1) and (2) while self driving.

# Constraints:
Time
Color detecting

# RESEARCH and BRAINSTORMING:
Practical Functions of the Robot Using a rear-wheel drive system the bot will be able to perform the follow (the following list is in order of priority)

# PRACTICAL FUNCTIONS OF ROBOT:

● Moving in all directions

● Lane following

● Acceleration and deceleration

● Braking

● Color Detection

● Turning

● Obstacle detection

● Obstacle avoidance

Our robot is built using the **Nous AI Car** (Matata Studio), which uses block-based programming through the **Matata Nous AI Studio** platform.  
The car will:
- Follow colored lines accurately (orange, red, blue, green)  
- Adapt to randomized starting directions (left or right)  
- Execute precise autonomous parking at the final zone

We are focusing on **tuning color thresholds**, **calibrating turning angles**, and **optimizing route logic** using Nous AI’s visual programming environment.

##  Hardware & Software
**Hardware**
- Matata Nous AI Smart Car Kit  
- Built-in camera module (for line and color detection)  
- Integrated steering system (compatible with Nous AI platform)  
- On-board sensors for detection and parking

**Software**
- Matata Nous AI Studio (block-based programming)  
- Internal HSV calibration tools for color detection  
- Onboard firmware for line tracking and path planning
