The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) is a globally recognized robotics competition that inspires students to push the boundaries of innovation. It provides a platform for young minds to demonstrate their technical expertise, creative thinking, and problem-solving abilities through the design and programming of robots to complete diverse challenges.

Among the most forward-thinking divisions is Future Engineers, where teams are encouraged to develop robotic and automated solutions to real-world problems. This category nurtures future innovators by promoting critical thinking, originality, and engineering skills, preparing participants to become the next generation of tech pioneers.

For 2025, the Future Engineers challenge focuses on designing and building a self-driving vehicle. This theme encourages teams to explore advanced concepts in robotics, introducing new layers of complexity, autonomy, and creativity, making it one of the most exciting categories in the competition.

# ROBOT AIM and OBJECTIVES
Aim The aim of the robot is to swiftly maneuver its environment or parkour. This involves

# Objectives:

1. Detect obstacles in the environment.
2. Avoid obstacles in the environment.
3. Perform (1) and (2) while self driving.

# Constraints:
Time
Color detecting

# RESEARCH and BRAINSTORMING:
Practical Functions of the Robot Using a rear-wheel drive system the bot will be able to perform the follow (the following list is in order of priority)

# PRACTICAL FUNCTIONS OF ROBOT:

● Moving in all directions

● Lane following

● Acceleration and deceleration

● Braking

● Color Detection

● Turning

● Obstacle detection

● Obstacle avoidance

##  Project Description
Our robot is built using the **LEGO Spike Prime / EV3** platform, combined with an **OpenMV camera** for computer vision.  
The robot autonomously:
- Follows colored lines (orange, red, blue, green)
- Handles randomized starting directions
- Parks precisely using vision and distance sensors

By integrating OpenMV, we achieve more accurate **color thresholding**, **path control**, and **parking alignment**.

## Hardware & Software
**Hardware**
- LEGO Spike Prime / EV3 Robot Kit  
- OpenMV H7 Camera   
- Custom mounting bracket for camera

**Software**
- LEGO Spike App (Python Mode) / EV3dev for control  
- OpenMV IDE (for camera vision scripts)  
- GitHub for version control  
- PYbricks
