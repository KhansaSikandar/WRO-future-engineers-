All programs were created using **Matata Nous AI Studio**.  




When program starts:
    Set servo angle as new zero point
    Turn on camera preview
    Turn on camera white balance
    Turn on color block detection
    Set color block to BLUE with L: 60.80, A: -10.18, B: -5.10

Forever:
    Move forward at 80% speed
    If BLUE detected:
        Move forward 25 cm at 80% speed
        Increase servo angle by 12째
        Move forward 105 cm at 80% speed
        Turn servo counterclockwise to zero point
When program starts:
    Set servo angle as new zero point
    Turn on camera preview
    Turn on camera white balance
    Turn on color block detection
    Set color block to ORANGE with L: 60.80, A: -15.10, B: -5.10

Forever:
    Move forward at 80% speed
    If ORANGE detected:
        Increase servo angle by -12째
        Move forward 105 cm at 80% speed
        Turn servo clockwise to zero point

DEFINE Green B:
    Set color block to GREEN with L: 5.30, A: -25.5, B: -5.15
    If GREEN detected:
        Stop moving

DEFINE Red B:
    Set color block to RED with L: 20.45, A: -5.15, B: -10.20
    Set servo angle as new zero point
    If RED detected:
        Stop moving
When obstacle distance < -5:
    Set servo angle as new zero point
    Turn on color block detection
    Turn on camera preview
    Turn on camera white balance
    Set color block to RED (L:20.80, A:30.50, B:15.35)

    Move forward at 70% speed

    If RED detected:
        Increase servo angle by -11째
        Move forward 30 cm at 70% speed
        Increase servo angle by 20째
        Move forward 40 cm at 70% speed
        Turn servo counterclockwise to zero point
        Move forward 20 cm at 70% speed





These represent the complete logic of our robot. The programs were tested and refined during each stage of development.
